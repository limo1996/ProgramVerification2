Tests that we have created are structured in 4 folders:
 * Advanced : Complex tests that are testing more than one error, contain domains, axioms etc ...
 * Algorithms : Implementations of some well known algorithms that could be implemented in our limited setup.
 * Laws: Axioms in boolean and integer arithmetics that have to always hold.
 * Unit : Unit tests that focus on one particular error type, no domains ...
 
 ## Advanced
 **We have created following advanced tests:**
  * Graph paths
  * Complete graph paths
  * Reverse of a sequence
 
 ## Algorithms
 **We have implemented following algorithms:**
  * Binary search for a number
  * Binary search on a sorted sequence
  * Vector addition
  * Inner product of two vectors ????
 
 ## Laws
 **Boolean algebra:**
  * Commutativity law
  * Associativity law
  * Distributivity law
  * Identity law
  * Annihilator 
  * Indempotence
  * Absorbtion
  
 **Integer arithmetics:**
  * Selected laws that should hold in integer arithmetics
  
 ## Unit
 **Error types that we test for:**
  * Assertion might fail
  * Invariant might not be preserved
  * Invariant does not 
  * Postcondition might not hold
 
 # Bonus: Matrix addition
 **TODO:** Kostas please fill this chapter up
